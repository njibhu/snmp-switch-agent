# snmp-switch-agent

Implement an agent for snmpd to monitor switches managed using the `swconfig` openwrt utility.
This is work in progress and currently targets only one device.

### Support currently targets:

- Atheros AR8337

### Tested on:

- TPLink Archer C7

### Notes

This should become useless whenever openwrt will support these switches using DSA (Distributed Switch Architecture)
